This section documents custom detection rules implemented in the Wazuh SOC Lab environment. These detections enhance visibility into suspicious activity based on Windows Sysmon logs and other log sources.

## Included Rules

- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
  - Detects and logs all process creation events from Windows agents.
  - Rule ID: `100105`
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1059.003 â€“ Windows Command Shell

- **Winword launching PowerShell:**
  - Detects suspicious behavior where `winword.exe` spawns `powershell.exe`.
  - Rule ID: `100100`
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1204 (User Execution)

Each detection includes the rule logic, alert behavior, and expected use cases.
