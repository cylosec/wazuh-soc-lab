# Wazuh SOC Lab: Threat Detection & Incident Response

Welcome to my homegrown Security Operations Center (SOC) lab.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, and secure a hybrid SOC using **Wazuh**, **OpenSearch**, and **custom detection rules**.

## What You'll Find

- **Infrastructure**: AD + Hyper-V + Ubuntu + SIEM
- **Attack Simulations**: Phishing, Brute Force, Privilege Escalation, C2
- **Wazuh Alerts**: Real JSON snapshots from my lab agents
- **Incident Playbooks**: Detailed response actions
